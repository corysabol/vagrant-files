### Ubuntu

This is the Ubuntu xenial vagrantfile with a basic vagrant file and some provisioning scripts. Anything that has prov-\* is not set default in the Vagrantfile. You will have to add it to the Vagrantfile.

#### provisioners

I now have to different provisions, ansible and bash, and they have corrisponding folders. `cd` into whichever folder you want and you can do `vagrant up` and then it will start up the machine.
