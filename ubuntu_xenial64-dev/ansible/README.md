### Ansible

To use ansible you have to check and/or install python to make sure that can work. That is what the pre-prov.yml is for.

These yml files should work on all ubuntu boxes please submit an issue if you are having a problem with any of them. Make sure you have th pre-prov.yml run before any of the others, so you can make sure that python is installed.
